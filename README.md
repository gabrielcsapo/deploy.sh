# deploy.sh

A self-hosted deployment platform. Deploy and manage applications from your own server with a CLI and web dashboard.

## Features

- **One-command deploys** — run `deploy` from any project directory
- **Auto-detection** — supports Node.js, static sites, and Dockerfiles
- **Web dashboard** — monitor deployments, view logs, track resources, and manage containers
- **Subdomain routing** — each app gets its own `<name>.localhost` URL
- **Live container logs** — stream logs in real time from the CLI or dashboard
- **Resource metrics** — track CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O over time
- **Request analytics** — automatic traffic logging with status codes, response times, and RPM
- **Deploy history** — full audit trail of deploys, restarts, and deletions
- **Multi-user auth** — register accounts, token-based authentication

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **Docker**

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/deploy.sh.git
cd deploy.sh
pnpm install
```

## Start the server

```bash
deploy server
```

Or with a custom port:

```bash
deploy server -p 3000
```

This starts the dashboard and API on `http://localhost:5050` (or your chosen port). The server handles deployments, auth, Docker builds, and subdomain proxying.

## Create an account

```bash
deploy register
```

You'll be prompted for a username and password. Credentials are stored in `~/.deployrc`.

## Deploy an app

From any project directory:

```bash
npx deploy
```

Your app will be bundled, uploaded, built into a Docker image, and started. Visit `http://<name>.localhost:5173` to see it running.
