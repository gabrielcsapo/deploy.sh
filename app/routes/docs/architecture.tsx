      <h1>Architecture</h1>
      <p>
        deploy.local is designed to be simple. It has a small surface area and few moving parts, so
        you can understand and modify it easily.

      </pre>

      <h2>Server</h2>
      <p>
        The server is a Node.js HTTPS server that runs on port 443 by default (falling back to 8443
        if 443 is unavailable). It is the fleet control plane: it handles authentication, receives
        uploads, schedules work, stores deployment metadata, owns mDNS and TLS, and routes traffic.
        It can execute Docker work locally or dispatch authenticated jobs to enrolled agents. A
        separate HTTP server on port 80 redirects browsers to HTTPS and serves the CA certificate
        and CLI install script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each deployed application gets its own <code>.local</code> hostname via mDNS. The server
        tracks the active node, LAN address, and relay port so it can proxy requests to the right
        container without changing the public hostname.
      </p>

      <h2>Coordinator and agents</h2>
      <p>
        There is exactly one coordinator. Additional Linux and macOS machines enroll as execution
        agents with short-lived one-use codes. Agents heartbeat their platform, Docker capability,
        private LAN address, running applications, and version. They claim queued jobs over
        authenticated outbound requests; credentials can only be revoked by an administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Application traffic is the exception to the outbound-only control path. Each agent exposes a
        small LAN relay for its assigned container ports. This also works around desktop Docker
        runtimes such as Colima that publish ports only on the Mac&apos;s loopback interface.
      </p>

      <h2>HTTPS and certificates</h2>
      <p>
        deploy.local uses HTTPS for all traffic. On first startup, it generates a local Certificate
        Authority (CA) and a server certificate using <code>openssl</code> (which must be installed
        on the server machine). The server certificate includes SAN entries for every deployment
        hostname (e.g. <code>my-app.local</code>) and is automatically regenerated when new
        deployments are created.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid browser TLS warnings, you need to trust the CA certificate on each client machine:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the CA cert: <code>curl -O http://deploy.local/ca.crt</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>macOS:</strong> Open the file to add it to Keychain Access, then set it to
          &ldquo;Always Trust&rdquo; in the certificate&apos;s Trust settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Linux:</strong> Copy to <code>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/</code> and run{' '}
          <code>sudo update-ca-certificates</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The CA and server certificates are stored in <code>.deploy-data/certs/</code>. The TLS
        context is hot-reloaded when certificates change, so existing connections are not disrupted.
      </p>

      <h2>Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        deploy.local uses session-based token authentication. When you register or log in, the
        server generates a token that is stored in the <code>sessions</code> table (server-side) and
        in <code>~/.deployrc</code> (client-side). Every API request includes the username and token
        in HTTP headers.
      </p>

      <h2>Deployment pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        When you run <code>deploy</code> from a project directory:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Bundle</strong> &mdash; The CLI creates a <code>.tar.gz</code> archive of the
          project directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Upload</strong> &mdash; The archive is uploaded to the server via a multipart form
          POST to <code>/api/upload</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Place</strong> &mdash; The coordinator resolves the application&apos;s pinned node
          or the fleet default.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Classify</strong> &mdash; The server inspects the extracted files to determine the
          project type (Docker, Node.js, or static).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Configure</strong> &mdash; If a <code>deploy.json</code> exists, port
          configuration is read from it (custom app port, extra ports).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Migrate</strong> &mdash; If placement changed, managed volumes are backed up,
          transferred through the coordinator, and extracted on the destination before the build.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build and run</strong> &mdash; The selected machine extracts the retained source,
          builds the image, starts the container, and health-checks its local port.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify and switch</strong> &mdash; The coordinator verifies the agent relay is
          reachable, stores the node and runtime metadata, switches traffic, and cleans up the old
          container.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Request routing</h2>
      <p>
        The server includes a catch-all route that proxies incoming requests to the appropriate
        container. When a request comes in, the edge route table joins the deployment with its
        active node, then forwards to either loopback (coordinator-owned) or the node&apos;s private
        LAN address and relay port. Each proxied request is logged with its method, path, status
        code, and response time. Only the coordinator advertises mDNS records.
      </p>

      <h2>Remote terminal and logs</h2>
      <p>
        Dashboard WebSockets always terminate on the coordinator. For remote containers, interactive
        terminal frames are multiplexed through the authenticated agent control channel and attached
        to a Docker exec PTY on the execution node. Runtime log reads are dispatched as agent jobs.
        The remote Docker socket is never exposed to the coordinator.
      </p>

      <h2>Data storage</h2>
      <p>
        All data is stored in a SQLite database at <code>.deploy-data/deploy.db</code> using Drizzle
        ORM with better-sqlite3. No external database server is needed. The database contains these
        tables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>users</strong> &mdash; username and hashed password.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>sessions</strong> &mdash; auth tokens with username association and creation
          timestamps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>deployments</strong> &mdash; container ID, name, port, extra port mappings, type,
          directory path, environment variables, memory limits, volumes, GPU settings, owner
          username, and timestamps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>history</strong> &mdash; audit trail of deploy, restart, and delete events per
          application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>request_logs</strong> &mdash; HTTP request log per deployment (pruned after 90
          days).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>resource_metrics</strong> &mdash; CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O samples per
          container (pruned after 30 days).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>build_logs</strong> &mdash; build output, status, and duration for each
          deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>backups</strong> &mdash; metadata for volume backups (filename, size, label).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>system_settings</strong> &mdash; server-wide configuration (e.g. rsync backup
          settings).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Uploaded project files are stored in <code>.deploy-data/uploads/</code>. Persistent volume
        data is stored in <code>.deploy-data/volumes/</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>A maintenance cycle runs every 6 hours that prunes old data and runs a database VACUUM:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Resource metrics</strong> &mdash; pruned after 30 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Request logs</strong> &mdash; pruned after 90 days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All other data (deployments, history, build logs, backups) is preserved indefinitely.</p>

      <h2>Environment variables</h2>
      <p>The server respects these environment variables:</p>
